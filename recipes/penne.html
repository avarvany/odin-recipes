    <h3>Steps</h3>
    </div>
    <ol id="pesteps">
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne to the boiling water and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>At the same time, melt butter in a stockpot over medium-low heat. Add shallots; stir and cook for about 3 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add mushrooms; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle mushrooms with flour and stir to coat. Pour in chicken stock and bring to a simmer. Sprinkle some rosemary and thyme into your hand and crush herbs to release the oil. Add them to the pot on top of the mushrooms and stir. Add a grind of salt and pepper. Stir and taste.</li>
        <li>Pour heavy cream into the simmering pot and stir to combine. Let it cook and bubble up for a few moments, then mix in cream cheese and stir until cream cheese has melted. Taste. Remove pot from heat and stir in Parmesan cheese if the mixture needs a little more salt.</li>
        <li>Stir sauce again and add pasta. Stir. Turn out mixture into a large, wide-rimmed bowl. Sprinkle parsley on top. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
